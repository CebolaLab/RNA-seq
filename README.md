The pipeline covers the following steps:

- [Pre-alignment quality control (QC)](#pre-alignment-qc)
- [Alignment](#alignment)
- [Post-alignment QC](#post-alignment-qc)

## Pre-alignment QC

#### Generate QC report

The raw sequence data should first be assessed for quality. FastQC reports can be generated for all samples to assess sequence quality, GC content, duplication rates, length distribution, K-mer content and adapter contamination. For paired-end reads, run fastqc on both files, with the results output to the current directory:

```
fastqc <sample>_1.fastq.gz -d . -o .

fastqc <sample>_2.fastq.gz -d . -o .
```

#### Adapter trimming 

If there is evidence of adapter contamination shown in the fastQC report (see below), adapter sequences may need to be trimmed, using a tools such as cutadapt, trimmomatic and fastp. In this pipeline, fastp is used to trim adapters. 

```
fastp -i <sample>_R1.fastq.gz -O <sample>_R1.trimmed.fastq.g -I <sample>_R2.fastq.gz -O <sample>_R2.trimmed.fastq.gz --detect_adapter_for_pe -l 100 -j <sample>.fastp.json -h <sample>.fastp.html
```

## Align and quantify

For this RNA-seq pipeline, the steps include:

- Align to the reference human genome (GRCh38) using STAR 
- Input the aligned `sam/bam` file into Salmon for quantification against the reference transcriptome 
- Convert `bam` to `bedGraph`, normalise and visualise against the reference genome


> Align to the reference genome (GRCh38)


The filtered DNA reads must next be aligned to the reference genome. For RNA-seq data, a splice-aware aligner such as STAR or TopHat should be used. Here, [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) is used. The manual is available [here](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf). The reference genome used is the GRCh38 'no-alt' assembly from ncbi, recommended by [Heng Li](http://lh3.github.io/2017/11/13/which-human-reference-genome-to-use). The genome can be downloaded at [this link](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38/seqs_for_alignment_pipelines.ucsc_ids/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz).  This version of the recent GRCh38 reference genome excludes alternative contigs which may cause fragments to map in multiple locations. The downloaded genome should be indexed with STAR. Other sources recommend the Ensembl [Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz](ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-77/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz), however [Heng Li](http://lh3.github.io/2017/11/13/which-human-reference-genome-to-use) notes that this version of the genome includes multi-placed sequences such as the pseudo-autosomal regions on both chromosomes Z and Y, as well as some alpha satellites. 

Set --sjdbOverhang to your maximum read length -1. The indexing also requires a file containing gene annotation, which comes in a `gtf` format. For example, ENCODE provides a gtf file with GRCh38 annotations, containing gencode gene coordinates, along with UCSC tRNAs and a PhiX spike-in. This file (ENCFF159KBI) can be downloaded [here](https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF159KBI/). The user should aim to use the most up-to-date reference files, while ensuring that the format is the same as the reference genome. For example, UCSC uses the 'chr1, chr2, chr3' naming convention, while ENSEMBL uses '1, 2, 3' etc. The files suggested here are compatible. 

```
GENOMEDIR=/path/to/indexed/genome

STAR --runThreadN 4 --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir $GENOMEDIR --genomeFastaFiles $GENOMEDIR/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna --sjdbGTFfile ENCFF159KBI.gtf --sjdbOverhang: readlength -1
```

STAR can then be run to align the fastq data files to the genome. If the fastq files are in the compressed `.gz` format, add the `--readFilesCommand zcat` argument. 

```
STAR --runThreadN 4 --genomeDir $GENOMEREF --readFilesIn <sample>_R1.fastq.gz <sample>_R2.fastq.gz --outFileNamePrefix <sample> --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate
```

> Quantify

The aligned `bam` file will next be input into [Salmon](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/) for transcript-level quantification. There are several transcriptomes which you can download, including from Ensembl and GenCode. This pipeline will use the [GenCode transcriptome](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_35/gencode.v35.transcripts.fa.gz) (here linked to release 35, but the user is recommended to select the most recent release) which contains curated sequences for both coding and non-coding RNAs. (Notably, Ensembl also includes predicted transcripts).

The benefits of using Salmon are that it uses an expectation minimisation (EM) approach to quantification. This is described in the 2020 paper by [Deschamps-Francoeur et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020303032), which describes the handling of multi-mapped reads in RNA-seq data. As described by [Deschamps-Francoeur et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020303032), duplicated sequences such as pseudogenes can cause reads to align to multiple positions in the genome. Where transcripts 




 For this reason, the analysis steps will be different if (1) aligning to the reference transcriptome, rather than the reference genome or (2) if analysing different classes of RNA (e.g. short RNAs of miRNAs), since sequence similarity levels are higher across the genome. The abundance of each class of RNA (e.g. mRNA, lncRNA, snRNA, miRNA, rRNA, snoRNA) will differ depending on the study protocol and focus, for example whether there was poly-A or size-based selection included during the library preparation. 


```
salmon quant -i gencode.v35.transcripts_index


 -l A \
         -1 ${fn}/${samp}_1.fastq.gz \
         -2 ${fn}/${samp}_2.fastq.gz \
         -p 8 --validateMappings -o quants/${samp}_quant
```

### Merge files

At this stage, if samples have been sequenced across multiple lanes, the samples files can be combined using `samtools merge`. Various QC tools can be used to assess reproducibility and assess lane effects, such as `deeptools plotCorrelation`.

## Post-alignment QC

The post-alignment QC steps involve several steps:

- [Remove mitochondrial reads](#remove-mitochondrial-reads)
- [Remove duplicates & low-quality alignments](#tag-and-remove-duplicates-and-low-quality-alignments) (including non-uniquely mapped reads)
- Check the expected mapping to exons, introns etc.

### Remove mitochondrial reads

Remove mitochondrial reads. To assess the total % of mitochondrial reads, samtools idxstats can be run to report the total number of reads mapping to each chromosome. samtools flagstat provides a short report including the total number of DNA fragments.

```
samtools idxstats <sample>_sorted.bam > <sample>_sorted.idxstats

grep "chrM" <sample>_sorted.idxstats
```

The second column is the length of the chromosome and the third column is the total number of reads aligned to the chromosome (chrM). To see the total number of DNA fragments, run:

```
samtools flagstat <sample>_sorted.bam > <sample>_sorted.flagstat

head <sample>_sorted.flagstat
```

The % of DNA fragments aligned to chrM can be calculated as a % of the total DNA fragments. To remove any mitocondrial DNA, run the following:


```
samtools view -h <sample>-sorted.bam | grep -v chrM | samtools sort -O bam -o <sample>.rmChrM.bam -T .
```

### Tag and remove duplicates and low-quality alignments




In this pipeline, RNA-seq data was aligned to the reference genome using the splice-aware aligner, STAR. 

The approached to deal with multi-mapped reads are shown below, reproduced from [Deschamps-Francoeur et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020303032) Figure 3.

(A) Example of two genes sharing a duplicated sequence and the distribution of RNA-seq reads originating from them. The two genes are represented by boxes outlined by dashed lines and their common sequence is illutrated by a red line. The reads are represented by lines above the genes, purple for reads that are unique to Gene 1, orange for reads that are unique to Gene 2 and black for reads that are common to genes 1 and 2. (B) General classes to handle multi- mapped reads include ignoring them, counting them once per alignment, splitting them equally between the alignments, rescuing the reads based on uniquely mapped reads of the gene, expectationâ€“maximization approaches, rescuing methods based on read coverage in flanking regions and clustering methods that group together genes/transcripts with shared sequences [(Deschamps-Francoeur et al. 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020303032).


> Duplicate reads

The next filtering steps include marking and [optionally] removing PCR duplicates, as well as removing low-quality reads (described below). 

Duplicate reads can be marked and the % of duplicate reads viewed using:

```
picard MarkDuplicates QUIET=true INPUT=<sample>.rmChrM.bam OUTPUT=<sample>.marked.bam METRICS_FILE=<sample>.sorted.metrics REMOVE_DUPLICATES=false CREATE_INDEX=true VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT TMP_DIR=.

head -n 8 <sample>-markDup.metrics | cut -f 7,9 | grep -v ^# | tail -n 2
```

*Optional*: It may be recommended to remove duplicate reads if the % of duplicates is high. To remove duplicate reads, run the following code:

```
samtools view -h -b -F 1024 <sample>.marked.bam > <sample>.rmDup.bam
```

## Visualisation 

The QC-ed `bam`	file can be converted to a `bedGraph` format to	visualise sequencing trakcs using tools	such as	the UCSC browser \
or the integrative genomes browser. The	ENCODE blacklist regions can be	provided, to exclude them from the output:

```
bedtools bamCoverage --blackListFileName --normalizeUsing BPM -b <sample>.filtered.bam > <sample>.bedGraph
```


UCSC binaries bedGraph to BigWig?

## Quantification
